# Twittler
This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com).

"Twittler" link in the header will update the DOM with new tweets if viewing all tweets or reload all tweets into the DOM if the user is looking at a specific user's tweets.

Clicking a username will load a list of all tweets for a specific user or update the user's list of tweets if they are already being viewed.
